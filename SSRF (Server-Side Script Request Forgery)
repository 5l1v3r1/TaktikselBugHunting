Core Idea: Is there any external resource acceseed by any parameter which could be controlled by us. 

Polyglot: www.yoursite.com/your_resource

Simply capture the IP from which your resource is accessed. There we start, once we get the IP and we confirm that the resource is accessed by server-side, we are uo with our game for SSRF. 

SSRF Tools - Testing & Exploitation 

Tools: 
Burp Scanner, other few scanners in marketâ€¦

Testing:
As we know SSRF does not need automated fuzzing, because once we confirm a resource is accessible from the Server-Side we can confirm SSRF/XFPA. 

Exploitation:
Once we have confirmed SSRF, we can move on to further exploitation which includes the following but not limited to:
	1. Internal Server/Port Scan
	2. Access to File System
	3. SSRF via 306 Redirects
	4. Exploitation via other known protocols
